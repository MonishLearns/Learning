Full Table scan:-
 - To find a row in a large table we perform full table scan.
    - we need to read pages one by one all, this will require many I/O's
 - Reading large tables is slow
 - Requires many I/O's to read all pages.
 - we need a way to reduce.
 - The cost will be the no of pages we need to fetch and fetching each page is an I/O

Original B-Tree:-
    - Balanced Data structure for fast traversal.
    - B-Tree has nodes
    - in B-tree of "m" degree some nodes can have (m) child nodes
    - node has up to (m-1) elements.
    - each element has a key and a value.
    - the value is usually data pointer to the row.
    - Data pointer can point to primary key or tuple.
    - Root Node, internal node and leaf node.
    - A node = disk page.

How B-Tree improves performance:-
    - All key and values exists in all node of B trees
    - key will be the index and value will be the reference to the page number.
