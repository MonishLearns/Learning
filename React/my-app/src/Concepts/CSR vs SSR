Client Side Rendering (CSR) is a rendering technique where only the html skeleton is rendered on the server with the complete page render happening on the browser by downloading and executing all the necessary JavaScript.

we get HTML,CSS,JS separately and one by one and browser apply them to html.
1. initial Page loading is fast.
2. good for complex applications.

Server Side Rendering, also known as the classic or traditional SSR, is the process of rendering the complete HTML page on the server in response to a request and returning it to the client.
we get a full fledged HTML+CS+JS(ready to render) from the server.

React supports Client side rendering.
